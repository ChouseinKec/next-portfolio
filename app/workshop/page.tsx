                                            This is the third iteration of the robot. The second version was similar to this one, but due to various design and 3D printing errors, I decided to scrap it and rebuild this improved model.
                                            The primary purpose of this robot is to navigate inside wind-turbine wings, locate repair areas, drill as needed, and fill the designated spots with a two-component hardening solution. It is equipped with a total of 13 motors, has a line-of-sight range of approximately 500 meters, and operates on the 2.4GHz frequency band.

                                            The system consists of an Arduino Mega as the master located in the base, along with two Arduino Nano boards acting as slavesâ€”one in the arm and another in the tool head.

While the resolution is not crystal clear, it is sufficient for both navigation and precise drilling, offering the advantages of low latency and long-range transmission.

                                                    pfSense manages the firewall and network for my workshop. It serves as a reverse proxy server, DNS server, DHCP server, and personal VPN server. Setting up pfSense provided me with a deeper understanding of key networking concepts such as DHCP, DNS, VPN, reverse proxies, and proxies, as I needed to grasp these in order to configure the system effectively.

                                                    Mosquitto is a message broker that implements the MQTT protocol. It acts as an intermediary, enabling communication between Frigate, various Zigbee sensors, and <a href="#haos">Home Assistant</a> for seamless home automation. This setup facilitates efficient data exchange and integration across devices, enhancing the overall functionality of the smart home system.

                                            This is my first solar setup, consisting of a 1.5 kW solar panel array, a 5 kWh inverter, and a 600 Ah battery pack. It was primarily designed to ensure uninterrupted power for my server, sensors, and cameras during electrical outages. Currently, the system operates in hybrid mode: during the day, it relies on solar energy, and at night, it switches to grid power for continuous operation.

                                            Home Assistant is running on my <a href="#production">Dell</a> server and manages a variety of home automation tasks. It primarily uses the <a href="#production">MQTT</a> protocol to collect data from multiple sources, such as <a href="#production">Zigbee2MQTT</a> and <a href="#production">Frigate</a>. By leveraging Frigate&apos;s camera feeds, it identifies objects, particularly moving persons, and integrates data from various sensors, including PIR motion sensors for motion detection, temperature and humidity sensors for environmental monitoring, and microwave radar sensors for human presence detection.

                                            Using this data, Home Assistant intelligently controls devices like fans, air conditioners, lights, TVs, aquarium lights, and pumps. These automations are triggered based on factors such as time of day, device states, detected movement, temperature, humidity, and other conditions. To make monitoring and control easier, the system displays real-time data in 3D-rendered scenes.

This effect is achieved using a CSS trick with mix-blend-mode: lighten, which allows multiple light layers to be stacked seamlessly without any visual issues. This approach provides an intuitive and visually appealing way to interact with and monitor the automation system.

                                        I began my programming journey at the age of 16 with Visual Basic, working on basic projects like an alarm clock and a calendar. My interest in hardware led me to Arduino Mega, which introduced me to C++. One of my early projects was a low-cost RC car controlled by an Arduino-based transmitter, which received commands from a Visual Basic app I created via USB serial. The car could be controlled either through the app&apos;s UI or a keyboard.

                                    <p>
                                        In 2016, after graduating from university, I completed a 6-month internship at Codenorm GmbH, marking my first step into web development. I started by learning the fundamentals: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, and AJAX. Over time, I expanded my skills to include PHP, working with platforms like Magento and WordPress. By the end of this phase, I was also learning Angular, TypeScript, Git, and Docker.

                                        Between 2017 and 2020, I worked at Dost GmbH, where I contributed to various projects, including the development of custom small robots for specific tasks. This role allowed me to gain expertise in electronics, PCB design and prototyping, 3D modeling, 3D printing, as well as furthering my knowledge of C++ and C#. You can explore more about my work during this period in my FixIT and XPlorer projects.

                                        From 2020 to 2024, I returned to Greece and focused on deepening my knowledge of web development. I concentrated on the technical aspects, such as networking (pFsense) and server management (Unraid), while also learning React. This period was dedicated to mastering both the front-end and back-end intricacies of web development.

                                        I regularly use Blender for the visual graphics of my projects, primarily for non-engineering purposes. I have a solid understanding of textures, UV mapping, modeling, and basic shading, though I find shader nodes in Blender to be a vast and complex area that requires deeper exploration. In fact, most of the graphics featured on this website&apos;s scene were modeled and rendered in Blender, then converted into 2D SVGs using Figma for seamless integration into the website design.

                                        I primarily use OnShape to design parts for my robot projects. I find CAD modeling particularly effective for hard surface models due to its precision and accuracy. All of my robots are designed and assembled in OnShape, and the models are then exported to Orca Slicer for further editing and preparation for 3D printing.

Its intuitive tools allow me to quickly bring my ideas to life and visualize the final product. This process also helps me gain a clear understanding of what needs to be programmed and how to structure the development of my projects effectively.
