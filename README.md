# 🧠 Personal Portfolio — Built with Next.js, React, HTML & CSS Only

Welcome to the source code of my personal portfolio site, built using **Next.js** with a unique twist:  
All interactive components (animations, tabs, modals) are crafted **exclusively with HTML and CSS**, without relying on JavaScript logic.

## 📌 About This Project

This portfolio is designed to showcase my front-end development skills by taking an unconventional approach. While the project uses **Next.js and React** for structure and component logic, all user-facing interactions—such as tabs, modals, and animations—are implemented using **only HTML and CSS**, without client-side JavaScript logic.

This demonstrates how much can be achieved with core web technologies alone, while still maintaining the power and organization of modern frameworks like React.

**Key features built without JavaScript logic:**

- Tabbed content areas
- Modal windows
- Page animations and transitions
- Responsive layout

This method may not be ideal for large-scale production apps, but it highlights creative problem-solving and a strong foundation in web fundamentals.
